## About this Repository
The original problems can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2021 "Advent of Code 2021"). All code found here are (in some cases, inefficient) solutions to those questions.

### Folder Content
Most of the solutions are written in Java, although Problems 1 and 2 contain solutions in Python ~~from the one time I wanted to prove a point but proved the other person's point instead but that's another story~~.

It usually also includes an `input.txt` file (if it doesn't, there's an `input` variable near the top of the code).

Lastly, there's a README file with my thoughts on the problem at the very top, my solutions, and then the problems themselves.

### Running the Code
- I put my site-generated puzzle inputs either in `input.txt` or near the top of the code.
- The general syntax is `java ProblemXX`.
  - However, if you wish to run Problems 1 or 2 in Python, run `python3 Problem0X.py`.
  - Java code for Problems 1 through 7 use the old format: `java Problem0X input.txt [1/2]`.

## Extras
### Longest Runtimes Hall of ~~Shame~~ Fame
*Mainly so I can laugh at myself. I'm surprised there aren't more entries.*
1. *Problem 03 Part 2*: 15m 5.521s (when running a while loop that never incremented and thus could never satisfy the ending condition, corrected code takes <0.3s)

### Favorite Problems
1. [**Problem 12**](https://github.com/Daphne-Qin/AdventOfCode2021/tree/main/Problem12): a recursion problem, but a nice recursion problem! Seemed scary at the beginning, but got pretty straightforward once I started coding everything out.
2. [**Problem 13**](https://github.com/Daphne-Qin/AdventOfCode2021/tree/main/Problem13): a problem where, in terms of coming up with solution logic, the input had something to offer, too!
3. [**Problem 06**](https://github.com/Daphne-Qin/AdventOfCode2021/tree/main/Problem06): simple yet deceptive.

### Most Annoying Problems
1. [**Problem 16**](https://github.com/Daphne-Qin/AdventOfCode2021/tree/main/Problem16): I know a lot of people (specifically, Redditors) liked this problem. But this problem made me reread the question for more than four hours and wrecked my confidence in myself (after all, how come everyone else understood the problem and I couldn't understand it after my best shot). And even after all that, I *still* didn't understand the problem. I know the algorithm has simple implementation, I just can't understand the specifics of what I am supposed to do. I have not fully solved this problem yet.
2. [**Problem 11**](https://github.com/Daphne-Qin/AdventOfCode2021/tree/main/Problem11): coming up with the solution wasn't easy. Debugging my logic errors was super duper annoying. I *hated* looking through thirty-something maps to check the difference between each iteration (and this was from octopus to octopus, so there were 100 maps per iteration).
3. [**Problem 04**](https://github.com/Daphne-Qin/AdventOfCode2021/tree/main/Problem04): this took ~2.5h to implement, and I'm pretty sure it would've taken less time to do it by hand.

## Future Plans
Later!
