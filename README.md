## About this Repository
The original problems can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2021 "Advent of Code 2021"). All code found here are (in some cases, inefficient) solutions to those questions.

### Folder Content
Most of the solutions are written in Java, although Problems 1 and 2 contain solutions in Python ~~from the one time I wanted to prove a point but proved the other person's point instead but that's another story~~.

It usually also includes an `input.txt` file (if it doesn't, there's an `input` variable near the top of the code).

Lastly, there's a README file with my thoughts on the problem at the very top, my solutions, and then the problems themselves.

### Running the Code
- I put my site-generated puzzle inputs either in `input.txt` or near the top of the code.
- The general syntax is `java ProblemXX`.
  - However, if you wish to run Problems 1 or 2 in Python, run `python3 Problem0X.py`.
  - Java code for Problems 1 through 7 use the old format: `java Problem0X input.txt [1/2]`.

## Extras
### Longest Runtimes Hall of ~~Shame~~ Fame
*Mainly so I can laugh at myself. I'm surprised there aren't more entries.*
1. *Problem 03 Part 2*: 15m 5.521s (when running a while loop that never incremented and thus could never satisfy the ending condition, corrected code takes <0.3s)

### Favorite Problems
1. [**Problem 12**](https://github.com/Daphne-Qin/AdventOfCode2021/tree/main/Problem12): a recursion problem, but a nice recursion problem! Seemed scary at the beginning, but got pretty straightforward once I started coding everything out.
2. [**Problem 05**](https://github.com/Daphne-Qin/AdventOfCode2021/tree/main/Problem05): nice longer coding experience that required a bit more thought for the diagonals. Also gave me some nice alternative solutions to consider trying out in the future.
3. [**Problem 06**](https://github.com/Daphne-Qin/AdventOfCode2021/tree/main/Problem06): simple yet deceptive.

### Most Annoying Problems
1. [**Problem 11**](https://github.com/Daphne-Qin/AdventOfCode2021/tree/main/Problem11): coming up with the solution wasn't easy. Debugging my logic errors was super duper annoying. I *hated* looking through thirty-something maps to check the difference between each iteration (and this was from octopus to octopus, so there were 100 maps per iteration).
2. [**Problem 04**](https://github.com/Daphne-Qin/AdventOfCode2021/tree/main/Problem04): this took ~2.5h to implement, and I'm pretty sure it would've taken less time to do it by hand.

## Future Plans
Later!
