### Basic Personal Info
**Name**: Daphne Qin\
**Class**: APCS\
**Period**: 5

## About this Repository
The original problems can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2021 "Advent of Code 2021"). All code found here are (in some cases, inefficient) solutions to those questions.

### About the Code
- I put my site-generated puzzle inputs either in `input.txt` or near the top of the code.
- The general syntax is `java ProblemX input.txt [1/2]`.

### Longest Runtimes Hall of ~~Shame~~ Fame
*Mainly so I can laugh at myself.*
1. **Problem 03 Part 2**: 15m 5.521s (when running a while loop that never incremented could never satisfy the ending condition, corrected code takes <0.3s)

### Future Plans
Later!
