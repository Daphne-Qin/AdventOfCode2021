# Day 19: Beacon Scanner

### December 19
As said in my README for [Problem 18](https://github.com/Daphne-Qin/AdventOfCode2021/tree/main/Problem18#day-18-snailfish):
>>> As for today's problem, I looked at the length of the description, and noped out. Problems [16](https://github.com/Daphne-Qin/AdventOfCode2021/tree/main/Problem16#day-16-packet-decoder) and 18 were both long and have surpassed my mental torture quota.

I'll be back on... well, hopefully before 2022?

## Part 1
Too long! [Here it is on AoC.](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/19)
