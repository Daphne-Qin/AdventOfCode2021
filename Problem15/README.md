# Day 15: Chiton
I knew that someday, I would encounter a roadblock. Someday, I would see a problem that, even with a generous dose of Google searches, I wouldn't be able to solve. I didn't know what day it would be, but I knew it would come.

I noticed, as I did problem after problem, that I gradually took longer, on average, to do them. I didn't know when there would be a day where, even after many potential hours spent on the problem, I still wouldn't be able to understand the reasoning behind the correct methods to solve it. But I knew it would come.

I've learned so much over the past fifteen days (and yes, that includes today). That includes the bigger things like DFS, but also includes the smaller things like ArrayLists of custom objects. AoC has forced me to practice many of the things I've half-learned, and get very familiar with them. And for that, I'm thankful.

I'm slightly upset I can't understand how the A* and Dijkstra's algorithms work. I really did try, but I don't know how I would differentiate between a longer path that has a smaller risk sum versus a shorter path that has a larger risk sum. But I'm happy I did at least try solving the problem without searching anything up (I tried DFS and it ran on for forever... on the sample input), and I'm happy that I did try my best to understand the algorithms.

My father has always told me, "Don't run before you can walk." I think that I've reached the upper limit of things I can learn with my current skillset, and now, I'm trying to learn more advanced topics without solidifying my knowledge of more basic topics. I haven't even tried implementing BFS yet, and apparently Dijkstra's is an extension of that, and apparently today's problem is Dijkstra's on steroids.

Today is December 15. I've made it more than halfway, and I've done all the problems up to today's. I knew this day would come, but I didn't know when. In fact, I thought it would come a bit earlier. Perhaps it should've happened on Day 9, when I first learned about BFS and DFS. Perhaps it should've happened on Day 11, which I hated but powered through anyway. I've solved 14 whole problems, but it seems like I can't solve the 15th right now. But I'm happy I was at least able to pass the halfway mark. And I'll definitely come back to this problem once I have a good understanding of how A* and Dijkstra's work.

The problems only get harder from here. Of course I'll still look at them, but I don't think I'll be able to do all of them. Perhaps I won't even be able to do the majority of them.

And that's okay.

See [AoC](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/15), they have formatting I can't replicate again.

## Part 2
I can't access this.
